TODO
====

Sorted by priority (updated constantly):

- Rotating shapes for a specified degrees (to create a squircle/diamond rotated e.g. 90 degrees etc.)

- Customizing gap between dual-ring structure (between rings)

- Click animations (left/right separately)

- Deformations between curves (to create symetric but uneven structures - better visuals)

- Fix for Glow effect (only outside, never inside)
